#Bloggie

Bloggie is a React based Blog Application, wherein, an end user can read blogs, add new blogs, delete blogs, with the advantage of the blogs being text based! 😊 This gives a user a retro experience, with a minimalistic look on the front end. 

Tech Stack used / Techniques Applied: React, CSS, React Router, React Hooks (useState, useEffect, my own custom hook useFetch & useHistory), Form Input Handling using React, and state management on a broader aspect.

A quick demo can be seen here: https://youtu.be/ScEk2utzQjs
